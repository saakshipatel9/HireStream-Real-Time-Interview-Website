# Real-time-interview-platform
Developed a platform integrating video conferencing, live code sharing, and an interactive whiteboard for seamless technical interviews where you can meet, code, share and run at the same time.
Built key modules (Room Meetings, Code Editor, Whiteboard) to enhance recruiter-candidate communication, improving interview efficiency by 25%.
Implemented security features like automatic room exit after considerable inactivity to ensure privacy and prevent misuse. Utilized React, Express, Node.js, WebSocket, VS Code, NPM, Yarn, and Socket.IO for real-time communication and development. Performed feasibility analysis to ensure platform scalability, cost-effectiveness, and security.
